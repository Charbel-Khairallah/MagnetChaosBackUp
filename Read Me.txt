*** Visual Studio ***

- Run In Release Mode x86



*** Installer ***

- Make Sure That You Install The Game Somewhere That Does Not Require Admin Privileges
  In Order To Write Text Files In That Directory.
  Otherwise Your Controls Settings Won't Be Saved If You Don't Run The Game In Administrator Mode.
- Don't Move The Game .exe File After Installing It, Instead Create A Shortcut For It Anywhere.
